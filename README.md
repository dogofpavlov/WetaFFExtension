# WetaFFExtension

This is an extension for Firefox to add tiny bit of extra but extremely useful information to the Weta Workshop website.

Specifically there is an issue where Weta does not show the "Name" of the item you pre-ordered on the Pre-orders page.

This forces a user to first go to the Pre-orders page... find the order #, then go back to the My orders page, find that order #, 
then go inside that order to determine the name. After doing this about 20 or so times I decided enough was enough and if Weta doesn't 
want to add this SIMPLE bit of extremely helpful information I would do it myself.
