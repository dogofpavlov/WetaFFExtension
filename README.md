# Weta Workshop Website FireFox Extension

This is an extension for Firefox to add a tiny bit of extra but extremely useful information to the Weta Workshop website.



Specifically there is an issue where Weta does not show the "Name" of the item you pre-ordered on the Pre-orders page.

This forces a user to first go to the Pre-orders page... find the order #, then go back to the My orders page, find that order #, 
then go inside that order to determine the name. After doing this about 20 or so times and messaging Weta about this issue with no response...  I decided enough is enough and I would do it myself :D
